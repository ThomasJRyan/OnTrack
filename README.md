# OnTrack

**Turn your backlog into agent work, without leaving the terminal.**

OnTrack brings [Beads](https://beads.gascity.com) and [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) together in one keyboard-driven workspace. See what needs doing, give it to a coding agent, and follow the work through to integration.

## From idea to implementation

Browse six Kanban columns: **Open, Ready, Blocked, In Progress, Ready To Merge, Closed**. Open a Bead's right-side detail drawer for Markdown descriptions, comments, and dependency charts. Create Tasks, Epics, and children; paste local PNG or JPEG screenshots with `Ctrl+V`.

Mark tasks **Ready** and let OnTrack dispatch eligible work to Herdr agents in separate Git worktrees, with a concurrency limit you control. Need to start something immediately? Hand the selected Bead to an agent with `h`.

Agents commit and check their work, then signal **Ready To Merge**, not Closed. OnTrack closes a tracked Bead only after verifying integration into its recorded target. The worktree drawer preserves workspace focus, confirmed merge and cleanup, continue (`a`), and restart (`Shift+R`) actions. Automatic merging and cleanup are optional; verified integration still closes the Bead when both are disabled.

The board refreshes automatically, scrolls horizontally on narrow terminals, and scrolls each column vertically. Children integrate into their parent branch before closing. Settings include themes, a default agent, and a concurrent-agent limit. Run `ontrack update` to install a verified compatible release.

## Get started

OnTrack requires both commands on your `PATH`:

- **Beads (`bd`)** for issue tracking — [install Beads](https://beads.gascity.com/getting-started/installation).
- **Herdr (`herdr`)** for the shell and agent workspaces — [install Herdr](https://herdr.dev/docs/install/).

For macOS or Ubuntu 24.04-compatible Linux, with Bash, `curl`, and Python 3:

```sh
curl -fsSLo install-ontrack.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThomasJRyan/OnTrack/main/scripts/install.sh && bash install-ontrack.sh
```

The installer uses a compatible stable release and offers to install missing Beads and Herdr commands. Add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` if needed, open your project in a **Herdr shell**, then run:

```sh
ontrack
```

Use an interactive terminal with alternate-screen support. If the project has no Beads workspace yet, run `bd init` first. Building from this checkout instead? With Rust 1.88+ installed, run `cargo run` inside Herdr.

See [installation and updates](docs/installation.md) for supported architectures, prerequisites, updates, and removal. To remove the installed executable and OnTrack user settings, run `ontrack uninstall` and confirm the printed paths; Beads and Herdr remain installed.

## Keys to keep moving

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓`; `←` / `→` | Select a card; switch columns, including empty ones |
| `Shift+←` / `Shift+→`, `m` | Move a card to an adjacent column or choose a destination |
| `Enter` | Open Bead details; arrows / Page keys scroll the drawer |
| `n` / `Shift+N`, `e` | Create a Bead / child task, or edit the selection |
| `h` | Hand the selected Bead to a Herdr agent |
| `w` | Open worktree drawer; `Enter` focuses the selected Herdr workspace |
| `s`, `Ctrl+?` | Open settings or context-specific hotkey help |
| `Esc`, `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Go back; quit when no dialog is open |

All six columns retain empty counts. Moving to Ready schedules eligible agents; other moves do not start or stop them, and individual moves never cascade to children. Closed moves and `c` require fresh tracked integration proof; `d` permanently deletes after confirmation. See the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md), [settings](docs/settings.md), [development guide](docs/development.md), [CI checks](docs/ci.md), and [release guide](docs/releases.md).
